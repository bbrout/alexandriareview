Overview
This protocol enables editors to submit academic papers for double blind peer review without the need for a third party intermediary. It provides proof of publication for articles and related comments while withholding the identity of authors through the review process and obscuring the identity of reviewers in perpetuity. The protocol also enables the trustworthy transfer of publication fees to the paperâ€™s reviewers and editors.
