Overview
This protocol enables editors to submit academic papers for double blind peer review without the need for a third party intermediary. It provides proof of publication for articles and related comments while withholding the identity of authors through the review process and obscuring the identity of reviewers in perpetuity. The protocol also enables the trustworthy transfer of publication fees to the paper’s reviewers and editors.

Value propositions
    • University libraries (and other institutions) can function as publishers of peer-reviewed work without requiring third-party intermediary (i.e. journals) to ensure a trustworthy review process.
    • Academic institutions can enter into agreements directly with each other for the publication of work without a third party journal subscription.
    • Authors can archive comments along with their work without disclosing the identity of the reviewers.
    • The merit of institutions can be rewarded with full transparency in the peer review process.
    • Publication fees and subscription revenues can be earned by university editors and peer reviewers rather than third party journals.
